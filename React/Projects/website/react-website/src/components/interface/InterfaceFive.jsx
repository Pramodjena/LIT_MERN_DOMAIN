           People love web and native apps for different reasons. React lets you build both web apps and native apps using the same skills. It leans upon each platformâ€™s unique strengths to let your interfaces feel just right on every platform.

         With React, you can be a web and a native developer. Your team can ship to many platforms without sacrificing the user experience. Your organization can bridge the platform silos, and form teams that own entire features end-to-end.
